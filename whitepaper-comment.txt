I think platON initiative from LatticeX foundation is a very encouraging product. I was fascinated by the next-generation Internet infrastructure protocol based on the fundamental properties of blockchain and supported by the privacy-preserving computation network. This initiative has the potential to have some impact on the crypto industry. Security is now becoming an important feature in today's protocols, seeing platON giving an emphasis towards security is enlightening to the entire industry. Making the platform developer-friendly is also a note-worthy task.
